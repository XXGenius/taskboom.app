    <!--<p>Peter was born with achondroplasia, that is a dwarf. All his life he dreamed of becoming an actor, but in our theater and film world are very few roles for dwarfs - they usually offer to play buffoons or leprechauns. After high school, Peter was unable to find any suitable work actor and because of the lack of livelihood took a low-paying position of a specialist in the processing of applications. In this work, he spent 6 years in constant depression and a drunken stupor on Fridays and weekends. In 29 years in one of his sober days he promised himself to get anywhere, but only an actor, and then never do anything else.</p>-->

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In 1910, in The Sorbonne, in the center of Paris, US President Theodore Roosevelt read a speech, an excerpt from which many listeners would eventually learn by heart and call "The Man in the Arena":<br />"The critic does not matter... Not a man who points out where the strong stumbled or where the one who does business can handle it better.<br />Enthusiasm is worthy of who stands in the arena!</p>
    <p>Who has a face covered with mud, then with blood.<br />Whoever desperately fights is mistaken again and again - because there is no effort without errors. But who really does great deeds and who has learned enormous enthusiasm and great devotion to his cause! Who devotes herself to a worthy goal! Who at the best end will achieve the highest triumph, and at worst, if it fails, this is a failure in a lot of bravery! And therefore, he will never be among those cold and timid souls who are not acquainted with victory or defeat."</p>
    <p>Often you ask yourself the question: who am I - the one on the arena or the viewer?<br />Imagine being at the beginning of the path. The road will not be easy, and maybe you will not hold it off and you will go. But if you hold it, then become a hero. Say, inside you have a hero? If yes, you will go along this road and go out to the arena. This app is designed to help you on your way, to reach the end and to win. And even if you are gone, Golaso will help you get back on track.<br />Golaso exists to help people become the heroes of their life stories.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 20pt;"><strong>HOW DOES Golaso WORKS</strong></span><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the age of 30, Michael Phelps, the most famous contemporary scene, collected 28 Olympic medals - an absolute world record.<br />On the day Michael trains about 6 hours. 3 hours in the morning and the same in the second half of the day. The main task of an athlete - every day to swim about 18 km in different style and at a certain speed. Every day, since 7 years of age, the relentless task that has been carried out has made it the fastest swimmer of all time. Throughout his life, Phelps sailed about 136,000 miles, that is, if he floated from the North Pole to the South along the center of the Earth, then over the past 24 years Michael would have flown there and back 11 times!<br />Many of us have a great idea that can change the world. Without her incarnation she is just a dream, a dream about the future.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Golaso is built on the idea that any goal, reduced to the daily tasks performed, will be achieved regardless of anything.<br />The result is a character product. The character is formed by daily volitional actions.<br />Golaso reduces goals to one day and is guided by four basic principles:<br />1. Planning<br />2. Self-analysis<br />3. Gratitude<br />4. Reward</p>

    <p><span style="font-size: 20pt;"><strong>PLANNING</strong></span></p>
    <p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1918, Charles Schwab, president of the largest steel company in America, has come up with ways to increase the efficiency of his enterprise. Fate brought him down with Ivy Lee's performance advisor. Ivey promised to Schwab that he would be able to raise the productivity of the company in 15 minutes, and, moreover, he said that Charles could pay as much as he wished for these 15 minutes. Schwab agreed. Lee gave him a piece of paper that contained a list of 5 items:</p>
    <p>1. Every evening before the end of the day, write down the six most important things for tomorrow.<br />2. Arrange these matters of importance - from the most important to the least important.<br />3. Start the morning, at the beginning of the day, work on the most important business.<br />4. Do not go to the second case in the list until you finish the first one. Just do the second, third, and so on.<br />5. Repeat every working day.<br />Three months later, Schwab sent a consultant a check for $ 400,000 (according to today's standards) with a note that this advice became one of the most important in his life.</p>

    <p><br />Golaso teaches you to plan every day, week, and 12 weeks.<br />Maybe you want to know why not a year or not 5 years? The fact is that planning for more than 12 weeks does not work. How many times did you promise to start a new life on New Year's Eve? In January, it's impossible to squeeze in the gym - there are crowds of people who have given the word to change for the better. By March, in the hall freely, the annual promises did not work again.<br />The British research company ComRes in November 2015 interviewed a 2014 person in an attempt to find out how many of them at the end of the year achieved the goals scheduled earlier this year.</p>
    <p>80% of all respondents stopped following their goals after the first three months of the year.<br />The impossibility of predicting the execution of complex projects beyond 90 days was described by Douglas Hofstadter, a professor of cognitive studies.</p>
    <p>Hofstadter's law describes the difficulty of planning difficult goals and the constant underestimation by the person of the timeframes that are needed to complete the project. Our brain is arranged in such a way that it is much easier for us to imagine a non-existent alien from planet X than the flow of time without using clock associations or changes in the environment. For example, scientists predicted that a computer would win a person in a chess game 10 years earlier than it actually did!</p>
    <p>Thus, annual planning does not work for two reasons:<br />A) The human brain is not created to foresee long periods of time. It's much easier to predict tomorrow than the same day, but a year later.<br />B) Our inability to accurately calculate time resources exacerbated by procrastination - the habit of postponing urgent and important cases. The year seems so great that it creates the impression that there is enough time to achieve the goal. As a result, people are disfocusing in the course of time, penetrating and hoping that one day they will take for themselves that this never happens.</p>
    <p>Planning for 12 weeks helps to see the performance of the work in detail, focuses and adds to the sense of urgency. Plan for 1-3 goals every 12 weeks. Experience shows that this is the optimal amount. Planning more than three goals will distract or indicate that the first three are not sufficiently serious. Goals can be from one area (for example, only work), but they can also cover different spheres of your life (for example, study, career, sports, relationships).</p>

    <p><strong><span style="font-size: 20pt;">INTROSPECTION</span></strong><br />According to the World Health Organization, people are mostly killed by cardiovascular diseases. Heart attacks threaten both the inhabitants of developing countries and the developed. One of the causes of heart attacks is the inactivity of blood in coronary vessels. Surgeons solve this problem by moving in the heart of additional vessels, through which the blood, saturated with oxygen, can move. Nevertheless, this operation is quite dangerous, since it is necessary to stop the heart, and then to start it again.<br />In the early 2000s, researchers found a way to carry out this operation without stopping the heart. The procedure was complicated, and surgeons with 20 years of practice were difficult to master the new method.</p>
    <p>This innovation was recognized by Bradley Staats, a researcher at Harvard University. Bradley decided to observe which of the successful surgeons could not master the new procedure and why. In total, Staats and his colleagues attended 6516 operations and counted the number of deaths in the practice of each surgeon. At the end of the study, data analysis produced a very unexpected result. Later, a team of scientists will call this "Paradox of Failure."</p>
    <p>It turns out that after one unsuccessful operation, the surgeon, instead of learning from his own mistakes, made them even more in the next operation. While success in one operation usually led to success in the other. The essence of this phenomenon is that in their failures, people are inclined to blame the environment, and in their successes consider themselves "guilty" only. Some unsuccessful surgeons did not learn from their own mistakes, because they linked the death of the patient with his health or with poor equipment, with staff failures, etc.</p>
    <p>At the same time, those surgeons who constantly reflect on the operation, studied their mistakes and trained them more than not allowed, could "paradox of failure" to win.</p>
    <p>With the help of questions at the end of each week, Golaso gives you an opportunity to analyze your actions, successes and experiences. Constant self-examination and self-improvement as a result - this is what distinguishes those who are in the arena from the spectators.</p>

    <p><span style="font-size: 20pt;"><strong>THANKS</strong></span><br />Her brother died of AIDS, his sister - from an overdose of cocaine.<br />Grandmother beat her with a stick for disobedience. When she was 9, she was raped by her uncle and family friend.<br />At 13 she ran away from home. In 14 - gave birth to a child who died prematurely.</p>
    <p>By the age of thirty, Oprah Winfrey, the American television presenter, producer and America's most influential woman, according to Forbes, became a national celebrity. By forty - she already knew the whole world.<br />People with simpler destinies wake up with unhappy faces and forget about how much around the beautiful, and that one can enjoy life every day. Win-fries at the end of each day records 3-5 things, for which she is grateful. This simple habit focuses her on feeling happiness every day and allows you to look at all adversity with optimism.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Robert Emmons, Ph.D., a professor at the University of California, conducted an experiment whose goal was to understand how a sense of gratitude is to the physical and mental state of a person. In the experiment, 1000 voluneers aged from 8 to 80 years took part. All that the participants had to do was to write grateful thoughts in a notebook every day.</p>
    <p>Even Emmons was surprised by the results of the experiment: the elderly participants had decreased pressure, all the people had a stronger immune system, most of the participants who felt much happier and more optimistic. One of the reasons why they are full of gratitude. We can not forget that we can do this if we are busy contemplating positive things and are grateful for them. The more time we positively think, the more often we feel that what we want is happening to us.<br />And this, in turn, gives a sense of control over life and directly affect the sense of happiness.</p>
    <p>You keep in your hands Golaso , because you dream to achieve success. Possibly, the path will be difficult. But a smile will help - on the face and heart.<br />People around reach for smiling and happy people. Golaso will help your smile manifest. At the end of each day, write down 3 things for which you are thankful or who brought joy to you on this day. These things do not have to be big. You can enjoy the excellent weather, the call of an old friend or the smile of a passerby.</p>

    <p><span style="font-size: 20pt;"><strong>REMUNERATION AND SMALL VICTORY</strong></span><br />Teresa Amabile of the Harvard Business School studies how each day affects people and their productivity. In one of the studies of her team, she watched 238 volunteers whose work required solving difficult problems and constantly generating new ideas. The result of the study was an article titled "The Power of Little Victories," in which Teresa wrote that the main motivator in the work is a sense of progress.</p>
    <p>Daily progress is a daily gain. Thinking of small victories and noting them, we launch a neurochemical process, through which dopamine is produced and released. Dopamine is a neuro-mediator responsible for our motivation, energy and optimism. Progress today gives us a motivation for tomorrow. For the sense of progress, it is very important to carry out a case that marks the completion of the case: take the pen and check the task in front of the task. This is a great pleasure. Even more fun you will get, rewarding yourself after a successful week.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Every day, Golaso makes it possible to tick off the realized task, and at once two ticks if the task relates to 12-week goals. And to get a charge of dopamine the next day, we suggest that you write down your small victory at the end of each day.</p>
